Introduction :

where should i start ?, i guess a little history about relativity should
be a good place to start .

it all started on the 9th month of 1996, a weird looking nick name
chased me over irc and wanted me to help him code a magazine .

after the fall of rcn it was a good idea and a nice project to start, so i 
said YES .

so En|{rypt (later to be known as enkrypt) a few people from 
the old Rcn and we started coding the mag .

at the start i coded it with enkrypt and some asm dude, but he left ..
then for 6 months we coded it together, then we started to think that we just
HAVE TO RELEASE, so i took over the coding and started making the issues .

i wont tell about the following 2 years, but they were fruitful and my coding
had improved so much, the emag was and still the best coded Dos emag Known to 
menkind .

after 2 years i decided to share the engine with the world, and here it is
a fully configureable magazine (allmost) .

basically every lamer can start his own emag .


Compiling the Emag :
