Me and a couple of my buddies went into Car Chat on
AOL one day, This Log is between me and some guy
who thought i was a mechanic. We had a Little fun with
him as you can see as you read this. All in a day's fun.
I still wonder if he ever went to a Honda Dealer that
next day. I laugh everytime I come accross this Log.
It's a Classic. Hope it brings a smile to your face or
at least a chuckle to your day. Peace *~*

Greetz to Suupp and Kao on this one.

Morrisn415:     I saw in the channel that your a good mechanic.
EvilxxSTAR:     I try =)  tell me whats wrong with your car.
Morrisn415:	Symtoms: Surges during crusing,  Sometimes with the clutch pushed
in and starting to accelerate, rpms go down instead of up.
Morrisn415:	I have changed both fuel filters
Morrisn415:	After changing the first one, it stopped for aprox. 2 weeks, then
it started again.
EviLxxSTAR:	u try checking your clutch fluid?
Morrisn415:	So I changed the Primary filter, and it was fine on the way to
work, on the way back it started again. but worse
Morrisn415:	Clutch fluid?
Morrisn415:	I have no clutch fluid.
EviLxxSTAR:	NONE?
EviLxxSTAR:	what kind of car?
Morrisn415:	no.. no place to put clutch fluid
EviLxxSTAR:	try to adjust your bi-lateral bypass gasket to 3.21 mm
Morrisn415:	what would that do?
EviLxxSTAR:	should help with air intake and reduce preassure on the clutch
Morrisn415:	where would I look for the bi-lateral bypass gaskett?
EviLxxSTAR:	what type of car?
Morrisn415:	85 Honda Accord

EviLxxSTAR:	u must have the old standard
EviLxxSTAR:	but the side draft carbs have been known to blow up
Morrisn415:	what would make it stop then start again?  (surging that is)
EviLxxSTAR:	sure would
EviLxxSTAR:	that carb could be very worn out
EviLxxSTAR:	he gas fumes build up in the primary chamber of most side draft
carbs and when pushed the explode, killing most people in the area
EviLxxSTAR:	the=he
EviLxxSTAR:	Its a design flaw that can't be fixed
Morrisn415:	could it not be a the fuel pump?
EviLxxSTAR:	try putting your finger and the intake valve when the motors
running, if you feel it sucking air its fine
Morrisn415:	so if these carbs are known to blow up, then shouldn't they have
been recalled?
EviLxxSTAR:	they have been, take it to a dealer and they will replace them
right away
Morrisn415:	And that should fix my surging problems?
EviLxxSTAR:	diffenetley
Morrisn415:	was this a problem know with all sidedraft carbs, or just certain
manufacters?
EviLxxSTAR:	all of them
EviLxxSTAR:	only one maker for the Hondas
Morrisn415:	how do I know if it hasn't all ready been changed?
EviLxxSTAR:	the surging problem u are having tells me it hasnt been changed
Morrisn415:	but it has 160,000 miles, wouldnt it of developed dangerous
problems before now?
EviLxxSTAR:	the recall just was released 3 months ago when it started showing
problems and people died
