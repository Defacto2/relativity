Hi DJ & Ron 

Don Fooks brought me this joke at work yesterday. I thought you might 
get a charge out of it. I will talk to you later.

Lou & Pat


One day,Bob complained to his friend, "My elbow really hurts.I guess I 
should see a doctor." His friend said:"Don't do that, there's a computer 
at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than  a 
doctor. Simply put in a sample of your and the computer will diagnose 
you problem and tell you what you can do about it and it only cost $10."

Bob figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine 
sample and went to the drug store, finding the computer, he poured on 
the sample and deposited $10.

The computer started making some noises and various light started 
flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which 
read:
"you have tennis elbow.
Soak your arm in warm water.
Avoid heavy labour
it will be better in two weeks."

That evening,While thinking how amazing this new technology was,and how 
it could change medical science forever,he began to wonder if this 
computer could be fooled. He decided to give it a try.

He mixed together some tap water,a stool sample from his dog, Urine 
sample from his wife and daughter and to top it off,he masturbated into 
the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the computer, 
poured in the sample and deposited $10. The machine again made the 
sounds and printed out the final analysis:
"Your tap water is too hard
Get a water softener

Your dog has ring worm
Bath it in anti-fungal shampoo

Your daughter is using cocaine
Put her in rehabilitation clinic

Your wife is pregnant.....With twins
They aren't yours
get a lawyer

And if you don't stop jerking off
your tennis elbow will never get better!"
