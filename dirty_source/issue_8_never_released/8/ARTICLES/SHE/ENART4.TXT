We are The Children of the Eighties

We are not the first "Lost Generation" not today's Lost Generation; in fact,
we think we know just where we stand - or are discovering it as we speak. 

* We are the ones who played with Lego Building Blocks when they were just 
  building blocks and gave Malibu Barbie crewcuts with safety scissors that 
  never really cut. 
* We collected Garbage Pail Kids and Cabbage Patch Kids and My Little Ponies 
  and Hot Wheels and He-Man action figures and thought She-Ra looked just a 
  little bit like I would when I was a woman. 
* Big Wheels and bicycles with streamers were the way to go, and sidewalk 
  chalk was all you needed to build a city. 
* Imagination was the key. It made the Ewok Treehouse big enough for you to 
  be Luke and the kitchen table and an old sheet dark enough to be a tent in
  the forest. Your world was the backyard and it was all you needed. 
* With your pink portable tape player, Debbie Gibson sang back up to you and
  everyone wanted a skirt like the Material Girl and a glove like Michael 
  Jackson's. Today we are the ones who sing along with Bruce Springsteen 
  and the Bangles perfectly and ha ve no idea why. We recited lines with 
  the Ghostbusters and still look to the Goonies for a great adventure. 
* We flip through T.V. stations and stop at the A-Team and Knight Rider
  and Fame and laughed with the Cosby Show and Family Ties and Punky 
  Brewster and what you talkin' about Willis? We hold strong affections 
  for the Muppets and the Gummy Bears and why did they take the Smurfs off 
  the air? 
* After-school specials were only about cigarettes and step-families, the 
  Pokka Dot Door was nothing like Barney, and aren't the Power Rangers just 
  Voltron reincarnated? 
* We are the ones who still read Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, the Bobsey 
  Twins, Beverly Clearly and Judy Blume, Richard Scary and the Electric 
  Company. 
* Friendship bracelets were ties you couldn't break and friendship pins went
  on shoes - preferably hightop Velcro Reebox - and pegged jeans were in, as
  were Unit belts and layered socks and jean jackets and james and charm 
  necklaces and side pony tails and just tails. 
* Rave was a girl's best friend; braces with colored rubberbands made you 
  cool. 
* The backdoor was always open and Mom served only red Kool-Aid to the 
  neighborhood kids - never drank New Coke. 
* Entertainment was cheap and lasted for hours. All you needed to be a 
  princess was high heels and an apron; Sit'n'Spin always made you dizzy 
  but never made you stop; Pogoball were dangerous weapons and Chinese 
  Jump Ropes never failed to trip someone. 
* In your Underoos, you were Wonder Woman or Spider Man or R2D2 and in your
  treehouse, you were king. 

In the Eighties, nothing was wrong. 

* Did you know the president was shot? Star Wars was not only a movie. 
* Did you ever play in a bomb shelter? Did you see the Challenger explode or 
  feed the homeless man? 
* We forgot Vietnam and watched Tiananman's Square on CNN and bought pieces
  of the Berlin Wall at the store. 
* AIDS was not the number one killer in the United States. 
* We didn't start the fire, Billy Joel. In the Eighties, we redefined the 
  American Dream, and those years defined us. 
* We are the generation in between strife and facing strife and not turning 
  our backs. 
* The Eighties may have made us idealistic, but it's that idealism that will 
  push us and be passed on to our children - the first generation of the 
  twenty-first century. 

Never forget: We are the children of the Eighties...
