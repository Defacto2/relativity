=== MONICA LEWINSKY COUNTERS CLINTON ===
========= DENIAL OF RELATIONSIP =========

Monica Lewinsky, after weeks of silence, countered President Clinton's
firm denial that the two had any form of sexual relationship:

"I have had enough. This whole experience has left a bitter taste in my
mouth, and I can't stomach any more. I feel as if I am getting the
shaft, that this ugly matter has come to a head and blown up in my face.
This may be a load to handle, but when things are hard, that is when I
am at my best. I have faced hard things in the past, and I know what is
coming. I will meet this challenge the only way I know how...head on. I
have licked bigger things than this before, and I will again. No one
will ever be able to say that Monica Lewinsky isn't a finisher, that she
quit before the job was done. I will work non-stop and fight this, blow
by blow, until I am wiped clean of this dirty affair. I will not be
stained by it.
