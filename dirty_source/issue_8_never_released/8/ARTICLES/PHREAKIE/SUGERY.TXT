Things you wouldn't want to hear during surgery

It has been reported that some surgical patients have been able to
overhear comments made by physicians, even while in deep
anesthesia. Here is a list of things you wouldn't want to hear during
surgery:

Better save that. We'll need it for the autopsy.

Someone call the janitor - we're going to need a mop.

"Accept this sacrifice, O Great Lord of Darkness."

Bo! Bo! Come back with that! Bad Dog!

Wait a minute, if this is his spleen, then what's that?

Hand me that.... uh.... that, uh.... thingie.

Oh no! I just lost my Rolex.

Oops! Hey, has anyone ever survived 500ml of this stuff before?

Darn, there go the lights again...

"Ya know, there's big money in kidneys. Heck, the guy's got two of
'em.

Everybody stand back! I lost my contact lens! Could you stop that
thing from beating? It's throwing my concentration off...

What's this doing here?

I hate it when they're missing stuff in here...

That's cool! Now can you make his leg twitch?!

I wish I hadn't forgotten my glasses.

Well folks, this will be an experiment for us all.

Sterile, shcmerile. The floor's clean, right?

What do you mean he wasn't in for a sex change.....!

Anyone see where I left that scalpel?

And now we remove the subject's brain and place it in the body of the
ape. OK, now take a picture from this angle. This is truly a freak of
nature.

This patient has already had some kids, am I correct?

Nurse, did this patient sign the organ donation card?

Don't worry. I think it is sharp enough.

What do you mean "You want a divorce!"

She's gonna blow! Everybody take cover!!!

FIRE! FIRE! Everyone get out now!!

Darn! Page 47 of the manual is missing!
