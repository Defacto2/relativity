The top 11 reasons Clinton has...

11. Excuse me "Your Honor," but she was on top
10. I didn't want people to confuse me with the Pope on TV
9. She's not THAT young. In Arkansas, the age of consent is only 16
8. Hey, At least she's prettier than Paula Jones or Jennifer Flowers
7. I had to show the American People that I WASN'T impotent for my
second term in office.
6. I was jealous of Nixon with his 'Tricky Dick" nickname
5. I didn't leave a message on her voice mail. Get with it. This is the
'90s, I sent her E-MAIL!
4. See I'm not a Lame duck. She said I was pretty GOOD!
3. My real name is not William Jefferson Clinton. It's William
KENNEDY Clinton.
2. I couldn't control myself. It was genetic. I was in her jeans --
oops, I mean it was in my genes. 

AND for those of you who remember the famous "I DIDN'T INHALE" 
comes the now soon to be famous #1 excuse.......................

1. "I didn't insert"
