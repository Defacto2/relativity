A hippie gets onto a bus and proceeds to sit next to a Nun in the front seat. 
The Hippie looks over and asks the Nun if she would have sex with him. The Nun 
surprised by the question politely declines and gets of at the next stop. When 
the bus starts on it's way the bus driver says to the hippie, "if you want I can 
tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you." The hippie of course says 
that he'd love to know so the bus driver tells him that the every Tuesday evening 
at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery to pray to the lord. "If you went dressed 
in robes and some glowing powder," said the bus driver(male), "you could tell her 
you were God and command her to have sex with you." Well the Hippie decides to try 
this out so that Tuesday he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun. And right 
on schedule the nun shows up. When she's in the middle of praying the hippie walks 
out from hiding, in robes and glowing with a mask of god. "I am God, I have heard 
your prayers and I will answer them but you must have sex with me first." The nun 
agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. The hippie agrees to 
this and quickly sets about to go to work on the nun. After the Hippie finishes, he 
rips off his mask and shouts out,"Ha ha, I'm the hippie!!" The nun replied by 
whipping off her mask and shouting,"Ha ha, I'm the bus driver!!!"
