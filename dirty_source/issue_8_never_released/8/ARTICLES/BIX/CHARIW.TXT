<biXen> How Did u come up with the idea to start Rebels,(if u started it ?)
<Char-> i didnt start it.. rebels was formed in sweden in 1990
<Char-> by omnibuz and met.. two swedes
<biXen> ahh...ok
<Char-> they later merged with pantera.. and one and a half year
        ago.. i merged my group CB4 with REBELS
<biXen> ahh 
<biXen> ok
<biXen> :)
<Char-> i never really thought it through before i became the
        leader of cb4 eather.. they made me a leader cuz i was a good
        supplier and they didnt wanna lose me.. and after a while.. i
        really started working as a leader.. and foundout what it was
        all about..
<Char-> so i never learned from other leaders on how to run a
        group.. i had to figure it out myself.. since i've been in a
        leader position in all groups i've been..
<Char-> i just follow my heart ;)
<biXen> cool :)
