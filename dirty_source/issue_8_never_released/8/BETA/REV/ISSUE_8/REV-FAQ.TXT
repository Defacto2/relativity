   F.A.Q. on running Relativity Emag under the Windows 95/98 MSDOS Prompt.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   WARNING: Please note that the smooth ansi scroller in the emag
   does tend to freeze the emag on some computers (+bar also). If
   you encounter this problem simply choose the ANSI scroller which
   is the third scroller in F1 configuration from the main menu. By
   choosing this type of scroller the emag will not freeze anymore.
   Also, note the command line options by doing rev98-01 /?.

*  Please read this F.A.Q. before reporting bugs about the emag!

*  For stupid people who keep bugging me about "My MSDOS Prompt says
   Relativity Emag, how can I change that?" just go edit your MSDOS
   Prompt properties, click on 'Program' and change it. Also, there
   is a new feature to change the status on the MSDOS Prompt so type
   rev98-06 /? for help on this extra feature.

** if you happen to have a soundblaster and its in the pc and not working
   and the emag gets STUCK do this rev98-01 /v .. and dont bug us !!

** if the articles gets STUCK its because of the asm routines, they dont 
   seem to fit in any computer.. so just go in the f1 screen and change it 
   to ANSI MODE !

1. Highlight the MSDOS icon and press your right mouse button to open
   the properties window.

2. Click on the Program folder and make sure it says 'Maximized' where
   it says Run:. Also make sure the Close on exit checkbox is on.

3. Click the Advanced button under the Program folder and uncheck all
   the check boxes and most importantly Prevent MS-DOS-based programs
   from detecting Windows. This causes major problems! Our emag works
   better if it detects that its running under Windows.

4. Switch to the Font folder and make sure the button chosen is the one
   that says 'Both font types' and for the Font size: choose 'Auto'.

5. Click the Memory folder and make sure that all the pull-downs all
   say 'Auto in them. Make sure Protected is unchecked and Uses HMA
   is checked on. It is very important to disable Protected!

6. Click the Screen folder and make sure the button chosen for Usage is
   'Full-screen' and Initial size: is 'Default'. Check all the other
   checkboxes you see so that they are on.

7. Click the Misc folder and for Foreground uncheck Allow screen saver
   because if your screen saver goes on it can cause problems. For Mouse
   check QuickEdit on and uncheck Exclusive mode. For Background uncheck
   Always suspend, for Termination uncheck Warn if still active. The
   rest of the checkboxes can be turned on. Idle Sensitivity should be
   still in the middle between Low and High.

8. Click Apply to finish the settings and press OK. If it does not work
   properly in Windows we suggest running it in pure DOS. All you need to
   make sure of is that your sound drivers for DOS are installed and if you
   use the CD-ROM make sure you have your CD-ROM driver installed for DOS.

|       It is important to note that this will save the settings for       |
|       the current icon only. If you have more than one MSDOS icon,       |
|         you have to edit the properties for those too if you are         |
|          going to run the emag from those icons. Its important!          |
