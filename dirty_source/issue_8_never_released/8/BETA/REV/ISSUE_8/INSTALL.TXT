   -WARNING: READ REV-FAQ.TXT BEFORE RUNNING THE EMAG UNDER WINDOWS 95/98-

Installation Notes:

1) Please do not change the destination of C:\ or WINZIP will extract
   to C:\YOURDIR\REV\ISSUE_7 and you dont want that. All installations
   will be setup the same way to make it easy for you. The only time
   you would change C:\ is if you want to put it on your D:\ drive or
   something but I suggest you leave it to C:\ unless you absolutely
   have to change the destination. If you use PKUNZIP please make sure
   the ZIP file is in your root directory and use the pkunzip -d switch
   to extract the files into their proper directories and sub-directories.

2) If you wish to submit any material at all to Relativity Emag please
   read the NFO file or in the emag for information. The revfrmt.bin file
   format for submitting articles has been scrapped. Only normal text with
   a fixed width of characters is accepted. The format to name your article
   is aabbbbbb.txt. aa = first two initials of your nickname for example I
   would put en because my nickname is En|{rypt. bbbbbb = the remaining
   characters labeling your article. It can be in long filename format if 
   you feel there aren't enough characters. The extension should always be
   txt. For more information about our format send email to muaddib@usa.net

3) Lastly, just enjoy the emag and watch out for ISSUE #7 coming out in
   about three weeks from now. We are going to release the emag every (3)
   three weeks no matter how much content there is. If you don't feel there
   is enough content, contribute to the next issue because that is the only
   way the electronic magazine can survive. Writers are needed so apply!
