CNN - Bill Gates hit by cream cake in Brussels - Feb. 4, 1999

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- That's not egg on Bill Gates' face, it's cream.

The Microsoft chairman was hit in the face with a cream cake Wednesday in
Brussels.

He was entering a building to meet with Belgian government officials. The 
Belgian news agency says one person distracted Gates' attention, while 
another threw the cream tart. It hit Gates right in the face, leaving cream
all over his glasses.

The news agency says four to five people were involved and had a stack of 
cakes ready.

The one person who threw a cake got away, but police arrested another 
person and are questioning a third who filmed the event.

Microsoft said late Thursday it will not press charges.

Reuters reported that it was unclear if Noel Godin, a Belgian who has made
a name for himself and a lucrative business out of hurling custard pies in
the faces of the rich and famous, was behind the incident.
