Ever wonder what endless possiblities there is with Mr.Potatoe Head?
I have. 

I think mr potatoe head would be neat if you used a real potatoe tho,
then after you gave him a head and stuff he could just rot away.
Just think of the differant shapes of potatoes you could find too.

Heck you could use a yam or a eggplant, its uses are unlimited.
mr cucumber head, yam head, even a radish. could you see a radish with feet?
You could have a live garden of vegs with heads. Onions, carrots, etc.
Man I think I stubbled on to something here. I'm all excited now.
I have never seen anyone explore this avenue.
I think they would have to make bigger mr potatoe parts tho, an eggplant is big and
 would look silly with that lil head. I bet I could make millions.
the possibilities are endless!
Even a mrs potatoe head with lil boobs, cartoon characters, mickey mouse,
pluto, just to name a few.
