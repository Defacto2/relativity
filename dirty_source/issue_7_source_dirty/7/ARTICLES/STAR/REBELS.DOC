Ok all this bullshit about Rebels needs to end!
What's up
with this shit? Ok so someone is no longer in a group.
That doesn't mean that life ends, it doesn’t mean the leader
Is to blame. What it means is that group had to reorganize.
Simple facts, REBELS are not dying and Charley isn't killing
it off. She did what any leader would have had to do, male
or female. So don't start your little judgements. You weren't
there you don't know. It should have stayed private, of course
Doson was upset he was let go, that's understandable. But get
a grip people, you do what is good for the group. It wasn't
her decision alone. It was a team decision. God people get a
clue. Stop the petty rumors and stop adding fuel to the fire.
Charley earned the respect of all her members. Remember that
and don't go on rumors. You go girlfriend!
