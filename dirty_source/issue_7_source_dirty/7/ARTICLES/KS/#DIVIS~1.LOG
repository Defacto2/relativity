-------

	Hi, this is a transcript of a log from the last warez group I was
        in. (I quit the scene)
	The story is me and my mate Saintjohn were running a group called
        Division 8, which we set up to find good members to set up a new
        group.  It was basically a mole hunt.

	We had succesfully recruited all the members into the new group,
        so we decided to let Division 8 die.  But there were two idiots
        (i don't use the word lamer) who wouldn't let the boat sink even
        if it was half submerged.  Their names, Agent, and Needful.

	What went on before the start of this log is as follows:
	Agent kicked and banned Saintjohn for letting the group die, and
        agent + needful had appointed themselves high council members.

        Before entering this channel i had no idea about what had gone on
        previously...

You can't join #division8, you're banned!

	Now this I thought was odd, and stupid.  After all banning for one
        comment?

Retrieving info on bans against you...
There is 1 ban on #division8 against you:
Set by: NeEDFUL (*!*bob@*.auck.ihug.co.nz) at Fri Feb 06 20:03:16 1998

	During this period I spent a long time talking to agent about
        un-banning me, he went on about	how he doesn't believe in
        un-banning other peoples bans, and shit like that.  He eventually
	got the ban removed.
	
        This is also when i got told (by agent) that saintjohn was kicked
        from the group, by agent, for letting the group die.  I was also
        notified that Needful was now high council and that he could kick
        me whenever he wanted to. (didn't really worry me much seeing as
        i was a high council member at the time as well)

<Keiser_S> so u've kicked saintjohn
<Keiser_S> or did he resign
<agent> the mans a fool
<agent> i kiked him out
<Keiser_S> i c
<agent> he ran this shit for 6months and its been lame as fuck
<agent> and seeing that your sj's mate and best freind i dont think your
        trust worthy
<agent> and baldey dont like you
<agent> hes highcouncile now so if he wants you gone your gone
<Keiser_S> well i don't think i really need to stand up for myself.  I
           don't really care whether in your eyes i am a lamer, or
           somebody who does absolutely nothing.  Obviously you want to
           try to revive the dead, and i personally don't believe in
           that, so now, i leave.

That was my speech =)

<NeEDFUL_> nice speech :)

<agent> but your right about dead
<agent> sj has fucked this group in the ass

<Keiser_S> and to agent: bah, fuck it.

        And that ends the lame self destruction of a group.  What Agent
        didn't realise, is that when a group is dead, you shouldn't try
        to suck more life out of it, because you will find you have
        wasted you time.
