            What is the real meaning of "Hacking" to you?



         Ask yourself, what is the real meaning of hacking. 
       To most people it may be getting online connecting to 
       a distro site and downloading some 0day. If that is 
       what you think it is you are wrong. You would be called 
       a software pirate. The real hackers are the old 
       schoolers from the late 80's and early 90's. The 
       phreakers and the others who had the balls to break the 
       law such as wire fruad and breaking and entering. Now 
       the only ones that I see are the people that exploit 
       web pages. This is basically where a person will get 
       "root" access to a company that runs an ISP or other 
       business with security levels. I do not consider myself 
       to be a hacker but just a small time software pirate. I 
       am really sick and tired of people at my school and 
       stupid fucks over the internet claiming to be hackers. 
       They are just wanna-be lameass posers that need to be 
       exterminated. Now newbies are alright as long as they 
       don't get cocky. If you want to see some examples of 
       what i am talking about "exploited web pages" go to 
       http://www.hacked.net and you will see what I am 
       talking about.


       I am going to talk mainly about "exploit" groups such as
       LOU (Lords of the Underground), Claire Danes, No|D, and 
       other small time exploit groups. Some "exploiters" go
       and hack into companies alone and do it to tell the 
       system administrator they need to update their security
       which usually works. If the admninistrator doesn't get
       the hint they will hack it and change it on a daily 
       basis.


       You wanna see the best damn exploiter I have ever seen?
       optiklenz from LOU. You are the coolest and I hope you read
       this.

       Check his latest exploit out at 
       http://www.hacked.net/exp/org/hartnet/012598.html
       Optik was busted recently and it is sad to see him go.
       That is my greet to you.
 

       I appreciate what Lord Death did for me over Christmas Break.
       I gave him access to my shell acct. and what does he give me?
       He gives me root to my ISP and now I have the same amount of 
       access as the person that owns my ISP =) thank you Lord Death.
       If I had the knowledge to do this I would probably abuse it or
       get caught. Knowledge is power if it is used correctly.
