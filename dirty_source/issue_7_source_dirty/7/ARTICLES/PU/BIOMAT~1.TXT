<PU69Y> tell me exactly what it is you do here

<BioMatrix> well
<BioMatrix> mostly we talk about hacking stuff 
<BioMatrix> and most of our friends are here
<BioMatrix> its like a home if u will

<PU69Y> yes
<BioMatrix> we hack, because...........we look for knowledge
<BioMatrix> knowledge is power... most hackers say that, because its true

<PU69Y> if you don't mind me asking. what all have you hacked?

<BioMatrix> sorry thats classified

<PU69Y> ok i understand =)

<BioMatrix> thanx
<BioMatrix> I found the funny thing is that 
<BioMatrix> there is so few of female hackers 
<BioMatrix> like myself

<PU69Y> i have noticed that too

<BioMatrix> yea its sad
<BioMatrix> :O(

<PU69Y> there was an old warez group called GLOW (gorgeous ladies of warez)

<BioMatrix> most hackers are not as understanding as me
<BioMatrix> really
<BioMatrix> kwel
<BioMatrix> now a days we have to be careful 

<PU69Y> yes

<BioMatrix> the cops don't seem to understand that we look for knowledge

<PU69Y> tell me if you know, how optik was busted
<PU69Y> yes
<PU69Y> i know

<BioMatrix> yes optik was busted

<PU69Y> they seem to think that all you do is break into something to look
cool and damage files

<BioMatrix> not really true

<PU69Y> that is what the police and public think

<BioMatrix> there are some hackers that dood delete files and etc,.
<BioMatrix> yea its sad really
<BioMatrix> its kinda kwel to be an outcast

<PU69Y> how do you feel about posers? people who go around saying they hack
and when actually all the know how to do is nuke someone

<BioMatrix> I really thing its low self worth
<BioMatrix> I feel sorry for the fuckers

<PU69Y> hehe i know whatcha mean

<BioMatrix> I because I know that they will not last
<BioMatrix> heh
<BioMatrix> I have some people try to nuke me and say that they are hacker
<BioMatrix> and in fact they only have window OS

<PU69Y> yes that happens alot of the time on irc

<BioMatrix> in which I return the favor 10 fold

<PU69Y> hehe

<BioMatrix> heh
<BioMatrix> it will teach them a lession 
<BioMatrix> hopeful

<PU69Y> i think the public has heard of the group Claire Danes
<PU69Y> how do you feel about them?

<BioMatrix> I have
<BioMatrix> don't know reallt
<BioMatrix> really
<BioMatrix> this is a hacking mag?

<PU69Y> not really
<PU69Y> more of a warez mag

<BioMatrix> kwel

<PU69Y> warez related

<BioMatrix> kwel

<PU69Y> but i thought that it would be nice to add something most of us are
not used to seeing

<BioMatrix> yea
<BioMatrix> thats a good  idea

<PU69Y> what you guys do i would not know where to begin

<BioMatrix> well, we look untill we find it

<PU69Y> i go to www.hacked.net alot to see the latest exploits

<BioMatrix> oh hone theres is so many

<PU69Y> LordDeath, i gave him my login and password to my shell acct. and he
gave me root

<BioMatrix> really

<PU69Y> yep

<BioMatrix> u have been talking to him about the mag?

<PU69Y> i have about 400gb shell space now =)

<BioMatrix> shit
<BioMatrix> thats wicked

<PU69Y> no just in person
<PU69Y> well over irc

<PU69Y> i have mentioned him and optik in the mag

<BioMatrix> whoa
<BioMatrix> hehe these guys are pinging me here 
<BioMatrix> heheh

<PU69Y> how much do you guys risk every time you do an exploit?

<BioMatrix> yes
<BioMatrix> most of the time we do 

<PU69Y> everything?

<BioMatrix> no
<BioMatrix> just about 

<PU69Y> yes
<PU69Y> you can face alot of jail time if you get caught right?

<BioMatrix> we risk our asses for the thrill of knowledge
<BioMatrix> yes
<BioMatrix> I would take that change
<BioMatrix> I would take that chance
<BioMatrix> but I'd be smart about my hacking 

<PU69Y> yea if i had the knowledge to do what you do i would probably go
crazy and get caught =)
<PU69Y> i don't think i could control myself

<BioMatrix> ehbeh
<BioMatrix> u never know

<PU69Y> the thing that gets me is alot of you are under the age of 18

<BioMatrix> I fould out that whenI started to hack
<BioMatrix> I am 20
<BioMatrix> I started late
<BioMatrix> hehe

<PU69Y> i am 14 and would not know where to start

<BioMatrix> when I started to hack.

<PU69Y> cool

<BioMatrix> hehe noe:

<BioMatrix> newbies say : "can u teach me how to hack?" never say that

<BioMatrix> hackers will not help u if u do that
<BioMatrix> hi jon

<PU69Y> we yearn to learn =)

<BioMatrix> yeap

<PU69Y> or even every few hours
<PU69Y> i know i do

<BioMatrix> the elite hackers I am still new to the game
<BioMatrix> but I am at a point in my hacking life, that I can't go back the
way I was

<PU69Y> i kinda feel the same way with my life. that when i get a job working
with computers i will always be curious about warez and maybe if i learn, what you all do.

<BioMatrix> hehe before hacking, I was hanging arould weirdos that beileved
that they where the undead and vampires hehehe

<PU69Y> =)
