 Seinfeld is my favourite program on the TV.The humour is just so damn
 cool.All are like most guys,the things that happen is the kind of
 things that could happen to yourself.For example,for them,almost
 everything is wrong with their partners.Either they speak 2 cm from
 your face,or they eat loud or sumthing like that.

 Its a killing funny series.It makes a cool addition when u got Kramer
 sliding in the doors.One time the door was locked and he slid right on
 it.We heard a loud BANG! ,Seinfeld opened the door,and there Kramer
 was on the floor,screaming: Why are u locking the door ???
 If the tv stations in your country send Seinfeld,be sure to watch it.
 Its a great show...really Great...
