 -Lets Start With Your Full Handle,Age and Affils :-


HOSON of HYBRID. Age 23. Leader of Hybrid.





 -Tell us...How Is It To Be Leader(s) Of A Widely-
 -Known Group As HBD ?

Used to be a lot of work. Lately, since we haven't released anything, It's
really nothing special to be
the leader of an inactive group. It's quite a nuisance to logonto IRC though
and get alot of MSGS from
unknown lamers.




 -As Leader(s) of Hybrid...What work does that-
 -involve,and how much time do u use on HBD ?

I'm not wasting any time at all really on HBD. Last year I probably spent
50% of my "awake" hours on HYBRID.
Mad Turnip probably spent even more, letting HYBRID come before work and
education.





 -Can U Fill Us In On Whos The Current HBD Memberz ?-

Current Hybrid members:

HOSON, Mad Turnip, Cyber, Replicator, Jammer, Eci, Hando.

Not too bad, huh?







 -Are U doin anything of the work yourself(ves)-
 -Like Cracking,Ripping and so on...

Yes, I'm doing both actually. 95% of all HYBRID cracks/rips are performed by
either myself or Mad Turnip.








 -Which is Your Favourite Group (except HBD)-

RAZOR.






 -If U Could select one from another group to join-
 -HBD who would that be ?

Manhunter/RAZOR




 -What is happening in the near future with HBD ?-

Hard to tell. We're waiting for new opportunities, such as looking into the
ISO scene and hoping that there will be
some new kind of ISO protection (so that we won't be worthless, I mean,
anyone can create an ISO so we're not
really needed there)





 -How Long Are U Going to Keep Being Leader of-
 -HBD ?

Forever.





 -Tell Us The Funniest Thing Thats Happened to U-
 -Or just A story that u like...Or something cool-
 -from the old scene days...








 -How Did u come up with the idea to start Hybrid ?-

I used to be in CLASSIC on the Amiga. I wanted to create my own amiga
cracking group, but I was not so successful,
and PC was MUCHO easier. So that's kinda how things turned out by themself.





 -How old were u,and how did it go in the start ?-

It didn't go to well the first two (2) years, I was around 16-17 when I
started the group I think. HYBRID amiga was formed in September 1992, and we
only got one original (Mega-lo-mania). The first PC release was Prehistorik
II (April 1993).




 -If still available who was the members in HBD after-
 -first two months ?

Hmmm.. check www.defacto2.org (there should be some really old Hybrid intros
with that info, but I don't have it "handy")
