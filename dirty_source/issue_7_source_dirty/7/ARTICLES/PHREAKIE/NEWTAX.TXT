Title: New Tax?
Section: Misc
date: 2-11-98

The only thing the IRS has not yet taxed is your penis.  This is due 
to the fact that 40% of the time it is hanging around unemployed, 20% 
of the time it is pissed off, 30% of the time it is hard up, and 10% 
of the time it is in the hole.  On top of this, it has two dependents 
and both are nuts.

Accordingly, starting January 1, 1996, your penis will be taxed 
according to it's size.  To determine your category, please consult 
the chart below and confirm this information on page 2, section 7, line 
3 of your standard 1040 form.

 10-12 inches         --Luxury Tax             --$50.00
 8-10 inches          --Pole Tax               --$30.00
 6-8 inches           --Privilege Tax          --$15.00
 4-6 inches           --Nuisance Tax           --$5.00

Please Note:
-----------
- Anyone under 4 inches is eligible for a full refund.
- Males exceeding 12 inches must file for Capital Gains.
