Recently, all groups involved with releasing their emags using the Relativity
Viewer, have formed a universal channel on efnet. Everyone involved from every
emag will be aiding the creation of a primary channel, a primary ftp site, and
a primary website to distribute releases from all emags. This project is being
built from scratch and we need everyone from every emag who is involved to
join #emags and help us out. It would be very beneficial to everyone since
ideas can be coordinated from group to group and issues can be released much
quicker than usual. This involves submitting, beta testing and finally the
release (99% bugless) for every emag. The Relativity Emag Viewer is supported
throughout a variety of platforms. Such platforms and requirements include:

- 486DX/33MHZ OR BETTER
- 8MB RAM OR HIGHER (EMS/XMS ENABLED)
- VESA 32BIT OR 64BIT PCI VIDEO CARD (SVGA)
- 8BIT SOUND CARD OR BETTER
- OPERATING SYSTEMS INCLUDE DOS, LINUX W/DOSEMU, WINDOWS OSR1/OSR2/OSR3

If you would like to contribute to this project contact MuadDib on irc in the
channels #emags #relativity on efnet or by email at muaddib@usa.net.
