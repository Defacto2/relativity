   ..hum good thing you guys didnt really mentioned me at all.. I dont
   know who the Punisher is, what he does, what he is able to do. I just
   know one thing: if Razor 1911 means something to so many people it's
   because of what me (Randall Flagg), TRC, Marauder, Razor Blade,
   Sector9, and Butcher did in 4 years running the most popular and active
   group in the whole RAZOR story. It's so sad to see Razor 1911 site, and
   those persons being not even mentioned or mentioned as if they were
   morons and didnt count shit. Oh well. I do respect people, i believe in
   loyalty, and I've always and will always be a member of Razor 1911,
   even if it's just in my mind. I lost the number of how many games i
   cracked for MY group, can't even figure out how much time i dedicated
   to it, i got busted for it. And I dont think what you guys are doing it's
   fair. Randall Flagg - Proud member of Razor 1911 since 1991.

   Come on TP... Give some credits to the ones that gave you a name. You
   wouldn't been leader of the worlds most famous and succesful groups
   without them. They diserve a mention. Hopefully this will change in the
   future .nfo's...
