Installation Notes:

1) Please do not change the destination of C:\ or WINZIP will extract
   to C:\YOURDIR\GRP\ISSUE_? and you dont want that. All installations
   will be setup the same way to make it easy for you. The only time
   you would change C:\ is if you want to put it on your D:\ drive or
   something but I suggest you leave it to C:\ unless you absolutely
   have to change the destination. If you use PKUNZIP please make sure
   the ZIP file is in your root directory and use the pkunzip -d switch
   to extract the files into their proper directories and sub-directories.
