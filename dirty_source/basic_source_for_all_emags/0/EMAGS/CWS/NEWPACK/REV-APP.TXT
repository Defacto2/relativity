3D GRAPHICAL ARTIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A time consuming job if your into making 3D models and actually good at it.
You must be using programs such as 3D Studio, 3D Studio Max., Bryce 2, or
Lightwave 3D and not Truespace or Adobe Photoshop. You must be able to submit
at least 1 pic per issue since we get so much art that its senseless to do 5
pics or something for one issue. You'll just be wasting your time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3D DEMO & SPRITE PROGRAMMING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must be able to use languages such as ASM/C++/PASCAL to code useful demos
that we can easily package with our emag. If you code in C++ we will not be
able to insert the code into our EMAG and therefore it will be packed with the
emag itself. If you code in ASM/PASCAL (not direct ASM, inline ASM in PASCAL),
we can easily integrate it into the code for our emag. You will have credit
for this and it will be shown in the emag. However, do not apply for this
position if you think you'll get our emag code because we wont accept you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must know how to use layers and the tools available in Adobe Photoshop 4.0
as well as plugin sequences to make great looking pics. However, there are no
positions open for this position at the moment so please DONT APPLY!

ANSI ARTIST                  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must be really good at making ansi's and active in the ansi scene. No lame
ansi's and you must be able to do a wide variety of tasks such as making menus
or logos. You must submit the art needed for each issue of the emag. If you do
not do your job we'll find another ansi artist. You may use your signature in 
your ansi's just as the VGA artists do in their VGA images as long as they do
not interfere with the ansi's look and as long as its not overly evident. You
must be familiar with shading and be able to do more than just simple text.

CHANNEL BOTMASTER            
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have access to T1 or higher shells and ensure that you are using the
safest and most updated version of UNIX eggdrop. You must be able to configure
the bot so it stays up 24/7 and does not have the following options set:

* -bitch (no +bitch mode on the eggdrop, that's bad!)
* no "please op me!" or "please invite me!" lines (annoying and causes klines)
* share 1 and passive 1 and make sure the bots are linked and sharing properly
* make sure the version reply is cloaked from ircops being suspicious so get
  some bitchx clone or something and improve it or update the ctcp replies
* all bots must link to 1 HUB bot, all leafs except for 1 bot, we do not want
  any other HUB bots, you will be running a leaf so make sure these modes are
  on your bot, +obsl and make sure that you dont have +h on the bot (NO HUB!)

Finally, if your bot is not hardly up, you will be forced to take down your
bots because its no use having bots that aren't updated and we lose ops for
nothing just because of your bot that joined a split and we have no access.

FTP & IRC COURIERS (NOT BBS COURIERS SO DONT APPLY!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have access to some of the top sites in the world that DO ACCEPT the
emag on their site without nuking it (if your an FTP courier). You must be
able to courier via FTP to our sites by gaining access to them directly from
the siteops or co-siteops. IRC couriers must concentrate on putting 1-2 xdcc
bots in #exceed #m8leech #warez950-dcc and any other BIG channels. The xdcc
bots must also appear in #relativity and be VOICED (+v).

INTERVIEWERS & WRITERS 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must submit at least 3 articles per issue. If you fail to do so you will
be expulsed from the group so dont blame us or bitch as us because we kicked
you out, you can still rejoin the group if you feel you can meet the future
requirements of the group. The articles MUST be in .bin format using our own
format made in ACiDDRAW by ACiD Productions and saved in .bin format (ansi).
The filename is always revfrmt.bin and can be downloaded off the members login
page on our website. If you must submit a .txt file of your article just make
sure it is layed out in paragraphs and NO LINE EXCEEDS 70 characters! If you
do not adhere to these requirements your article will be rejected. MuadDib is
the active president and all submissions (aka: subs) go to him. Even people
who are not members can submit! If you want to know what to write about read
the list of topics in the last section of this text file. Please note that in
1998 in the month of March we will be losing our best friend and my best bud
on the net, MuadDib. He maybe gone for months or even years. When that happens
I will be taking over the job of MuadDib. Please treat him nice while you can!

SITE HOST AND/OR WEBMASTER
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you can supply a domain for our group without any funds from any of our
members (the group), that would be appreciated. You will be responsible for
designing, uploading and keeping the website up-to-date. If you need any art
at all done for the website please talk to our artists. If you have someone
who would like to be a mirror site we can setup a mirror site list of all the
people who are mirroring our website. However, they must all be the same! I
dont want one site to be completely different from the other. They must be
setup exactly the same way. You must also have experience with at least doing
or setting up Frames, JavaScript, and Page Anchors (aka: Targets).
