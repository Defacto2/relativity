Instructions to run the emag:

1) Simply unzip the release with WinZip or pkunzip -d from your root.
   ie: C:\ will unzip to C:\GRP\ISSUE_?

2) To run the emag C:\GRP\ISSUE_? (whatever the dir is) and type the
   following: revxx-xx.exe fxxx-xx.mdb emag.mdb

3) You can do this for each emag using the Relativity Emag Viewer. It
   will work for all emags currently involved in the project. See other
   documentation for more information or contact MuadDib.

* Notice : the exe is included since the engine is still in early stages, 
  although no bugs, its not working like i want it to .. so if you see
  a release with an exe inside that exe will work on that release only
  but it will use the FX file, which will never change !
