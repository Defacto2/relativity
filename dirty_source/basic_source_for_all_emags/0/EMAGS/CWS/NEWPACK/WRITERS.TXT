Instructions for Writers:

1. Do not include the date the article was written if you don't want to.

2. Submit every article in a text file with the .txt extension only.

3. Use the first two digits of the filename as the first two digits of
   your nickname on irc or if someone else's is similar use 1st/3rd or
   something like that. For the remaining digits use it to call your
   article something. If you have long filename support you can type
   ren article.txt "nickname - title of my article.txt" between the
   " " so that it preserves the long filename as it was written.

4. For every line of text MAKE SURE it is only 76 CHARACTERS in length
   horizontally across the screen in EDIT.COM. (also known as the 76th
   RULE of Relativity)

5. Write your articles in paragraphs and do not bunch it all up into
   one big gob of text. It will look ugly and tire readers.

6. Include at the top of the article, your nickname and what section
   in the viewer that the article will appear in and don't forget the
   name of the article otherwise we cannot process it.

7. Before submitting check your spelling and grammar. If you must do
   it the easy way use a spell checker but be certain it's right.

8. If you feel that we need to add another SECTION to the viewer please
   let MuadDib know about it and he'll decide whether or not to add it.

9. If you have any questions regarding these instructions report to
   MuadDib on irc in #emags #relativity or email him at muaddib@usa.net.
