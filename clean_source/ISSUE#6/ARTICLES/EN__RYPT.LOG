<En|{rypt> ok lemme check
(µ) NOTIFY: Chromatiq (chrome@apollon.datashopper.dk) is on IRC (unknown host).
<MuadDib> ?
[blorght:tp963323@smoke.canberra.edu.au] it was a really crappy text encryptor I wrote for a guy in this channel (#cracking4newbies) to explain xor encryption of text files :)
<En|{rypt> hold i had to reply to an email
<En|{rypt> it took me this long to write the reply
<En|{rypt> its for the encryption program me and this guy are making
<MuadDib> hmm
<MuadDib> show me
<MuadDib> btw 
<En|{rypt> its all assembly language
<MuadDib> so what
<MuadDib> my friend can hack it
<MuadDib> in 1 hour
<MuadDib> everything u make
<MuadDib> dont waste time .. unless ur learning
<En|{rypt> no he can't hack it
<En|{rypt> get this
<En|{rypt> it reads a certain number of data sectors on a disk, only sectors with data, it formulates a key using that data it read from the disk to encrypt the file
<MuadDib> wanna bet ?
<En|{rypt> the only way to unencrypt it is to put the original disk with the same data
<En|{rypt> if the floppy changed in any way, even 1 byte, it won't work
<En|{rypt> and it dosen't store the key anywhere
<MuadDib> is it made ??
<MuadDib> show me
<MuadDib> and they will crack ti
<En|{rypt> no, its gonna take months
<En|{rypt> its not finished
<MuadDib> months
<MuadDib> come on 
<En|{rypt> when it is we'll see if anyone can crack it
<MuadDib> hehe
<MuadDib> remember my words brian
<En|{rypt> yes months, its very complex!
<En|{rypt> i've only done 148 lines of code
<MuadDib> 26000 on rev
<MuadDib> beat that !!
<En|{rypt> yeah but don't forget, this is asm! and its not a graphics engine
<En|{rypt> actually
<En|{rypt> to code rev in asm
<En|{rypt> it would take a REAL LONG time
<MuadDib> dont even thing
<En|{rypt> ;
<MuadDib> dont even think
<En|{rypt> don't even think about it
<En|{rypt> exactly!
<En|{rypt> hehe
<En|{rypt> but i love asm though, its real fun to program in
<En|{rypt> even if it crashes usually only the ms-dos prompt under windows closes... versus doing it through dos and rebooting like 10 times
<En|{rypt> hehe
<En|{rypt> guess what helped me a lot today
<En|{rypt> i found #2 source codes for rev on a disk

<En|{rypt> humm
<MuadBid> <valacar> I've seen two pages that just copied my links and everything...I don't appreciate that, 'cause it took me 1000's of hours looking for good webpages
<MuadBid> we will get our own links
<MuadBid> i have like 100 good ones
<MuadBid> i mean it
<MuadBid> very good
<En|{rypt> well like i got a problem with him saying that...
<En|{rypt> because Assembly Programming is a general topic
<En|{rypt> Game Programming is a general topic
<MuadBid> its ok ..
<En|{rypt> its not like we're gonna have the same content
<MuadBid> i wonder what he was talking about
<En|{rypt> like lotsa pages have the same link names
<MuadBid> listen 
<MuadBid> first
<MuadBid> i want an intro for cm 
<MuadBid> b4 he releases the next version
<MuadBid> saying about relativity .. insert my name and nick name there somewhere
<MuadBid> 2. a link for cm .. since our name is there
<En|{rypt> ok i will put a link to cm
<MuadBid> 3. i'll send u all my good links
<En|{rypt> i was gonna put it in the MuadDib's Programs section
<MuadBid> and u'll have tons
<En|{rypt> ok
<MuadBid> Sga is my program
<MuadBid> cm is not..
<MuadBid> just link them together from my page to the other ..
<MuadBid> <valacar> I don't care if you put a link to my page, just don't copy the links I have on my page...to me, it's starting to looks like another version of my page
<MuadBid> <MuadBid> man !!
<MuadBid> <MuadBid> we didnt even plan to
<MuadBid> <MuadBid> how can u accuse me...come on
<MuadBid> <valacar> I'm not accusing you...I'm just saying, don't make blatent copies of my links.
<En|{rypt> in other words he thinks we're copying him
<MuadBid> well .. lets prove him wrong
<MuadBid> lets have the best coding channel around
<MuadBid> like i allways wanted to !
<MuadBid> about that intro
<En|{rypt> well geez like we have a link to his page, he shouldn't complain
<MuadBid> i want it in 20 mins
<En|{rypt> too bad... i keep the damn links
<MuadBid> <MuadBid> i wont take even 1.. accept my home page if u dont mine ..
<En|{rypt> what do you mean intro?
<En|{rypt> i don't understand what you mean intro...
<MuadBid> except
<En|{rypt> what do u want me to do?
<MuadBid> small 10 lines- 20 lines of intro about relativity its products
<MuadBid> and the whole concept
<MuadBid> use the first l;ine from the web site
<MuadBid> about more than just an emag
<MuadBid> well a part of it anyways
<MuadBid> <valacar> of course the categories are general...but that "3D Graphics Demos" is the same as mine
<MuadBid> <valacar> nevermind, go ahead with your page, I'll probably take down my programming page anyway since I 
<MuadBid> keep all of his links !!
