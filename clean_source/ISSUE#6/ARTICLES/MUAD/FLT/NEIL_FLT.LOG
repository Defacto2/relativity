<NEiL-FLT> sure it's me
<Muad> hehe
<Muad> are u in fairlight ?
<NEiL/FLT> still is
<Muad> really
<Muad> how many contributing members there are in flt ?
<NEiL/FLT> nobody really contributing anymore I guess.... about 40 or 50 I think
<Muad> think or sure ?
<NEiL/FLT> who knows...
<Muad> is flt alive in the amiga or something.. u know still doing things ?
<Muad> can u give me a recent or latest Nfo ?
<NEiL/FLT> I mean... FLT is not active anymore so all the old dudes are
           till here
<NEiL/FLT> no .nfo's I think....
<Muad> what are the ages of the old dudes at flt ..(no nfo ???)
<NEiL/FLT> check www.fairlight.com or org and mail strider for more info
<NEiL/FLT> Strider is the leader
<Muad> i knew u'd do that
<Muad> NO, i want to talk to you
<NEiL/FLT> heheheyhe
<Muad> so .. what are the general age of the old folks ?
<Muad> what is..
<NEiL/FLT> hmmm...  20-30 or so
<Muad> wow
<Muad> old people
<Muad> any rumers of bringing flt again to the scene ?
<NEiL/FLT> well... youy have to consider that FLT has been in the business
           for more than 11 years now...
<Muad> already taken in consideration
<NEiL/FLT> so any in their teens whould have been kindergarten crackers
           in the early days
<Muad> hehe
<Muad> weird to thikn of them like that
<Muad> do u think that strider have all the nfo and telephones of all the
       members or where to reach them ?
<NEiL/FLT> so nowadays I think people just stick to FLT instead of being
           just another nerd....
<NEiL/FLT> now we are FLT nerds
<Muad> hehe
<Muad> answer the above .. :)
<NEiL/FLT> well FLT will as far as I'm concerned to return to the scene,
           as we have a strict policy of only bringing out full games
<NEiL/FLT> we do not rip off like 90% of the games to make a releaseable
           copy.
<NEiL/FLT> well we will not return to the scene is what I mean
<Muad> will be a nice thing
<Muad> now scene people prefer oldskool rather than newbies
<NEiL/FLT> yes...  but what makes newbies what they are today is that
           everybody with a T1 or 3 can rule the world if he's just a
           little devoted
<NEiL/FLT> in the old days when we were trading the states with 1660 cps
           in the middles of the night to release the warez
<NEiL/FLT> 10 minz before PDX would that was cool...
<NEiL/FLT> today you can make a script and go to sleep and your T3 will
           spread the warez before you turn off the light
<Muad> true :)
<Muad> but then again .. u need a good start b4 u can do something, some
       connections..
<NEiL/FLT> well but in the REAL old days, when we were all mailswapping,
           it could take years before somebody as big as FLT, Triad, DD,
           1001 or whomever would just
<NEiL/FLT> think nicely of you when they stole your disks
<Muad> what do u mean ?
<NEiL/FLT> well if some lamer at that time send me a disk with 5 old games
           and a demo he coded using the demomaker, I would not spend 2$
<NEiL/FLT> sending back his disk with new warez on
<NEiL/FLT> to get connections/contacts at time you needed warez....  to
           get warez you needed contacts...
<Muad> a loop with no end
<Muad> i still dont get something.. y would he send u a disk with old games
       and a shitty demo ?
<NEiL/FLT> well some lamer would send me (as I'm the trader right) a disk
           in the hope that I would think he was
<NEiL/FLT> just the fastest and coolest person in the world, as he had
           Ghostbusters, Rambo, Commando and Bruce Lee even though
<NEiL/FLT> they were like 2 months old.
<NEiL/FLT> Then he would expect me o send him back our NEW warez and then
           he could thade these warez to other goups etc
<NEiL/FLT> groups that is
<Muad> ohh
<Muad> u were snail mailing
<Muad> thats SLOWWWWWWW
<NEiL/FLT> hehheeh...
<Muad> jeez
<Muad> unbelieveable
<NEiL/FLT> well we used express mail and then taped the stamps so they
           cut be used again
<Muad> and u made it happen.. even more
<Muad> ohh
<Muad> hehe :)
<Muad> nice thinking
<NEiL/FLT> hey man....  we didn't even have a 1200 baud modem....
<Muad> 1200 ?
<Muad> no..
<Muad> jeeeeezz
<NEiL/FLT> yes....
<Muad> i know that someday u were all bbsing
<Muad> i remember my scene years since u were bbsing..
<Muad> dont remember snailmailing
<NEiL/FLT> once upon a time you could rule the world if you had a C64 with
           2 C-1581 diskdrives.... they could go as high as 720 kb disks
<NEiL/FLT> so you could have a bbs with 1.44 mb space!
<Muad> alot of space man,, what can i say ...
<NEiL/FLT> well nothing realle!
<NEiL/FLT> so getting connections today is a matter of hours and not
           months!
<Muad> (about strider having all the old members addresses,,,..do u
       think ?
<NEiL/FLT> well he is keeping record of the e-mail adresses
<Muad> only email
<Muad> dont u have a phone num record.. or addresses
<NEiL/FLT> ask him, but I doubt he will give them to you.
<Muad> i dont need them
<NEiL/FLT> no phone or adress
<Muad> i just wanted to know
< to know if he has address of his old buddies.. >
<NEiL/FLT> oki
<Muad> talk more about the old times man
<Muad> i love hearing those tales
<Muad> i was talking to hoson a few weeks ago
<Muad> i allways ask him about the old times
<NEiL/FLT> hehehe....  well it was better times, I mean people were more
           friendly and they all knew each other much better
<Muad> we both agree that it was ... something .. u know.. something
       better than just ...dont have a word.. sorry
<NEiL/FLT> well I think when I started an active career as a pirate Hoson
           was just a little boy in Science 451 or something like that
<hoson as a lil boy.. cracked me up :)>
<NEiL/FLT> well also attended big copyparties where groups from all over
           the showed up...
<Muad> reallt
<Muad> really
<Muad> tell me about it
<Muad> what was there, how was it
<Muad> neil ?
<NEiL/FLT> well, I mean wild! people freaked out, did everthing their
           parents would never think they could do,
<NEiL/FLT> once a party was held here in DK by Ikari. They've had a big
           party house... well that's what they thougt...
<Muad> man .. thats great
<Muad> more more !!
<NEiL/FLT> when more than 200 people showed up, it was a small logcabin
           with room for about 24 pupils or so....
<NEiL/FLT> the party moved on, but Triad remained behind a smashed the
           place.
<Muad> u mean.. that they moved to another place
<Muad> and that place crashed ?
<Muad> right..
<NEiL/FLT> well the next place was OK... just a little problem moving 200
           people with computergear 15 kms in the middle of the night
<Muad> oh GOD
<Muad> and ?
<NEiL/FLT> well the triad guys had spent a fortune going there... so they
           were a little upset..
<Muad> they moved all the people with their own money ?
<NEiL/FLT> well these Ikari guys found somewhere else...  that place was
           OK, and luckily it was in the middle of the summer.
<NEiL/FLT> well some guys had cars, so they just drove back and forth....
<Muad> oh god
<Muad> howm any cars  ?
<NEiL/FLT> don't remember.....
<NEiL/FLT> The one I drove with had a very small Fiat 127....
<NEiL/FLT> well another thing about that party...
<NEiL/FLT> we were like 6-7 dudes who went there....
<NEiL/FLT> 5 of us went first and the 2 last should come afterwards...
<Muad> man, those were the days
<Muad> today .. to organize these things its risky
<NEiL/FLT> well they arrived in the town where the party was supposed to
           be BUT the party place was 5 km from there
<NEiL/FLT> and it was in the middle of the night so they started to walk...
           suddenly they found a parked car and it was open...
<Muad> mm
<NEiL/FLT> so they tried to shortcircuit it...
<Muad> hahaha
<NEiL/FLT> well...  the only thing they didn'y notice twas the police
           coming by....
<NEiL/FLT> so the police stopped and asked them what the were doinf.....
<NEiL/FLT> my 2 friends answered that whey were looking for a coin so
           they could make a phonecall...
<Muad> haha
<Muad> jeez ...
<Muad> smart
<Muad> and ?
<NEiL/FLT> the police felt sorry for them and drove them to the party
           place (little log cabin the woods)
<NEiL/FLT> when they arrivced the police turned on the sirens.....
<Muad> oh goooooood
<NEiL/FLT> the German guest became so frightened that they jumped out of
           the windows and ran into woods in the middle og the night
