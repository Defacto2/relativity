<theprofil> ok
<theprofil> ok
<theprofil> when?
<MuadDib> i want to know more about the oldtimes of the scene
<MuadDib> right now
<theprofil> oki
<theprofil> since its you and everything =)
<MuadDib> lets start from the first time u actually thought you were in
          the scene.. and did something
<MuadDib> how was it like,..
<theprofil> confusing :)
<MuadDib> how come
<MuadDib> btw, at what age ?
<theprofil> well ... its hard to explain, except that I did a release for
            a group back then called Skid Row on the Amiga, from a request,
            and thought I was admitted then, but hey no, THEY WANTED MORE.
            I didnt understand shit about anything, and had to seek help
            somewhere else. I was 12 back then
<MuadDib> like 10 -12 years back or so ?, 
<theprofil> yep
<theprofil> thats correct
<MuadDib> thats along time man
<theprofil> yeah it is
<MuadDib> so, what happened next ?
<theprofil> and the times has gone by like hell :)
<MuadDib> hehe, yea i know :)
<theprofil> well, about a week later I joined Fairlight, as a supplier.
            And stayed with them for three years
<MuadDib> flt !!! love them !!
<MuadDib> loved their intros and all ..
<MuadDib> when i was a kid :)
<theprofil> yeah I still do, except that they are legit these days, as
            the Fairlight Industries
<MuadDib> tell me about those 3 years, (legit ??, industries ??)
<theprofil> those three years was perhaps the best years I had in the
            scene. I had to go to Sweden to deliver the rels, we traded
            on 1200bps modems and everything went blast when a new release
            was smashed. Its not like now, when people just say: oh, a new
            release. Cool. Bah, I think that if the scene stayed where it
            was, it would be a much better place. Anyways, as I said, flt
            has gone legit, and is selling cpu stuff. They are known as
            Fairlight Industries, operating from Sweden and the US
<theprofil> what can I say: shit happens :)
<MuadDib> go to sweden ?, i heared that in those times they snail mailed
          releases.... , also what happened when a rel was smashed :)
<theprofil> yeah we snail mailed the rels as well, but I wasnt a cracker
            back then, and had to go to a cracker just on the other side
            of the swedish border to make the rels :)
<theprofil> it was cool
<theprofil> but when a rel didnt need cracking, we simply released it
            ourselves under the FLT name
<MuadDib> about you going to the other side of the border.. how was it
          like really, what happened
<theprofil> (silent comment: I have a feeling this can take forever and
            more=))
<theprofil> well ... we cracked the releases and shipped them to the FLT
            WHQ and Courier HQ for trading
<MuadDib> (even more silent : this will take forever :) )
<theprofil> hehehe
<MuadDib> the period of the crack making itself, did u sleep over at that
          dude's place or what ?
<theprofil> yeah I had to sometimes. It was cool. We stayed up all night
            trying to figure out the protection, and when it was done,
            we sat and chatted with some other dudes on the WHQ bbs :)
            Bah, I miss it !!!
<MuadDib> do u have a memory of a night that you really loved ..  ?
<theprofil> yeah .. one night in special :)
<MuadDib> tell , do tell !
<theprofil> I came to sweden with Pinball Fantasies to make it cracked,
            and the cracker (which will be anonymous) had his sister
            staying over:) The rest will speak for itself, but it sure
            was a night to remember. He had to crack himself, as I was
            stuck in a bedroom all night. The next morning, he chased
            me down the road from his house and called me a guy to take
            advantage of his sister !:=))) BAH! I loved it :)
<theprofil> What can I say? Its dangerous being a supplier in the 80s :)
<MuadDib> hehehhe
<theprofil> but it was cool
<MuadDib> when he cracked he, and you were away in the bedroom, couldnt
          he figure out that.. you know
<theprofil> yeah he could, but he was strange in that way :)
<MuadDib> weird, better left unexplored :)
<theprofil> yep
<theprofil> brb ... have to go setting the video to record
<MuadDib> what other old scene stories do u have under your coat
